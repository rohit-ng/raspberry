# Main baremetal application that is started by the firmware once the
# hardware has been initialized. Usually, this is the Linux kernel but
# this can also be u-boot or barebox launched as a second level
# bootloader. Possibles values are "auto", so the kernel image will be
# autodetected from /boot and started directly by the firmware, or the
# name of the image to use from /boot/firmware
#
#KERNEL="auto"

# Possibles values are "auto", so the initramfs image will be
# autodetected from /boot and started directly by the firmware, "no"
# to skip initramfs handling, or the name of the image to use from
# /boot/firmware

#INITRAMFS="auto"
